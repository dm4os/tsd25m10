# Speed controller of autonomous vehicles

## Behavior-driven development [BDD] approach  
As a        driver
I WANT      the car to determine the speed limit and adjust the speed to that limit.
SO THAT     I don't have to adjust the speed myself

## Acceptance test-driven development [ATDD] approach 
GIVEN       the speed limit 70km/h
WHEN        the car in moving
THEN        the speed limit should remain/adjusted between 65 and 70km/h

GIVEN       the speed limit 70km/h
WHEN        the speed limit changes to 50km/h
THEN        deceleration rate should be 15km/h


System description:
* streets have signs to make drivers aware about the speed limit. 
    If I have a LIST of speed ranges then I would use a python list.

    Speed range are: []
    * 0 [0..30]km/h
    * 1 [30..50]km/h
    * 2 [50..60]km/h
    * 3 [60..80]km/h
    * 4 [80..100]km/h
    * 5 [100..120]km/h
