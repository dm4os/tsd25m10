# Speed controller of autonomous vehicles

## Behavior-driven development [BDD] approach  
As a        driver
I WANT      the car to determine the speed limit and adjust the speed to that limit.
SO THAT     I don't have to adjust the speed myself

## Acceptance test-driven development [ATDD] approach 
GIVEN       the speed limit 70km/h
WHEN        the car in moving
THEN        the speed limit should remain/adjusted between 65 and 70km/h

GIVEN       the speed limit 70km/h
WHEN        the speed limit changes to 50km/h
THEN        deceleration rate should be 15km/h
