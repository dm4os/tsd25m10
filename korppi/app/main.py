Case a. I will send a message to the ones who are coding better to complete a program where an speed 
limit is randomly generated and a function simulating a car response adapting to a certain speed 
limit.

Basically the "car" function would have 2 states old and current speed. The function would take 
the new speed limit, compared to the old one and print old and new speed limit.

# Speed controller of autonomous vehicles

## Behavior-driven development [BDD] approach
As a        driver
I WANT      the car to determine the speed limit and adjust the speed to that limit.
SO THAT     I don't have to adjust the speed myself

## Acceptance test-driven development [ATDD] approach
GIVEN       the speed limit 70km/h
WHEN        the car in moving
THEN        the speed limit should remain/adjusted between 65 and 70km/h

GIVEN       the speed limit 70km/h
WHEN        the speed limit changes to 50km/h
THEN        deceleration rate should be 15km/h(hvirtual)
