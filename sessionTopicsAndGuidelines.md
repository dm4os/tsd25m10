# Steps before start working on your projects

1. Make sure you open a git bush terminal or CMD window either separately or embedded on your IDE (e.g. Visual Studio Code).

2. Activate virtual environment(s) you need for running your applications
    -> Source <location of your virtual environment>/Scripts/activate  # On Windows
    -> Source <location of your virtual environment>/Bin/activate # On Linux
3. Pull repositories you are working on.
    case 1: You have SSH-config file then only -> git pull
    case 2: You DO NOT have SSH-config file then:
        a. Initialize the ssh-agent
            -> eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
        b. "Tell the agent" where and which an SSH PRIVATE KEY is located
            -> ssh-add ~/.ssh/<name of your PRIVATE KEY>

### TODO from 13:08 to 14:08
Based on the function we have created you need to:
1. Create a function which only returns SPEEDS LIMITS not intervals
2. Create a 2nd function which takes that generated SPEED LIMIT and returns it.
    example-> def myfunc(theGenSpeedLimit):
                    return (theGenSpeedLimit)
3. print the returned value of the executed function on step 2
4. git add ****, git commit ***, git push your changes

--> Based on the results of the previous exercise <--

Case a. I will send a message to the ones who are coding better to complete a program where an speed limit is randomly generated and a function simulating a car response adapting to a certain speed limit.

Basically the "car" function would have 2 states old and current speed. The function would take the new speed limit, compared to the old one and print old and new speed limit.

Case b. People who have struggle will stay with me. 

When people of <case a> are finish please, focus on the example given by RF official website -> https://github.com/robotframework/QuickStartGuide/blob/master/QuickStart.rst

Creare a dub folder under your name, label QSG, copy paste the scripts related to this exercise and run the tests. Study the report files generated by robot framework [rf] which are th e*.html files
