System description:
* streets have signs to make drivers aware about the speed limit. 
    If I have a LIST of speed ranges then I would use a python list.

    Speed range are: []
    * 0 [0..30]km/h
    * 1 [30..50]km/h
    * 2 [50..60]km/h
    * 3 [60..80]km/h
    * 4 [80..100]km/h
    * 5 [100..120]km/h
